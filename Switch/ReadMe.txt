create a python code
there should be one field which should search and find git repo from the parent directory.
with a UI having header as Git merge Conflict list
there should be 2 fields with from and to
there should be a button called generate report
on click of this button it should compare the branches given in from and to fields.
it should compare only the given repo folder paths that are given in a separate config file. once the report is ready it should create a csv report file where it should show all the conflict files with author and commit message which is having conflict in the to branch
